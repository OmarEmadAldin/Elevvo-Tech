# Classification Model Project

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks used to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning classification model.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data.ipynb`: Handles data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- `Classification_model.ipynb`: Builds, trains, and evaluates the classification model.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of metrics and performance
- Easily modifiable for new datasets

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch / Torchvision (if deep learning is used)
- OpenCV (if image data is used)

## ⚙️ Installation
To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Open and run `data.ipynb` to prepare your dataset.
2. Run `Classification_model.ipynb` to train and evaluate your model.

You can open the notebooks with Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy and loss metrics are displayed in the notebook.
- Visualizations of training and testing performance are included.

## 🧩 Customization
You can modify model architecture or hyperparameters directly in `Classification_model.ipynb`.
