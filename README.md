# üß† Custom CNN for Traffic Sign Classification

This project implements a **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs using TensorFlow and Keras.  
It is designed to process 64√ó64 RGB images and predict among **43 different traffic sign classes** (as in the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html)).
